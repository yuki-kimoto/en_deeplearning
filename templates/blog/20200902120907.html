<h2> What is the activation function? </H2>

The activation function is a function applied to express that a neuron is firing.

The output result of each layer is not passed directly to the next layer, but the one to which the activation function is applied is passed.

It's up to AI researchers to decide why they need to apply the activation function.

As a software engineer, keep in mind that applying the activation function will make learning go well.
