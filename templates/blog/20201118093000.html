<h2> Perl's Deep Learning Library-AI::MXNet </h2>

Perl's deep learning library includes <a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/AI ::MXNet"> AI::MXNet</a>. It is a library of deep learning written in C ++ that can be used by binding it with Perl.
First of all, if you want to actually try deep learning, you can easily (?) Use the library. Deep learning is also known as deep learning. If you're looking for a Perl library for deep learning, AI::MXNet is for you.

<h3> Official support for MXNet on Amazon AWS </h3>

MXNet has official support on Amazon AWS.

<blockquote>
Flexibility and choice

<b> MXNet </b> supports a wide range of programming languages ​​such as C ++, JavaScript, Python, R, Matlab, Julia, Scala, Clojure, and <b> Perl </b>, so you already know it. You can start in the language you are in. However, the backend compiles all the code into C ++ for maximum performance regardless of the language used to build the model.

AI::MXNet is one of the few Amazon Perl supports ...

<h3> Sample of image generation using deep learning </h3>

According to the English blog of AI::MXNet author Sergey V. Kolychev, it seems that you can also generate images using deep learning. The author himself seems to be doing deep learning related to natural language processing in his work.

<blockquote>
I hope you enjoy this example and create a lot of nice pictures. Below is an image generated by a sample script made from a classic painting that is different from the photo of Kyubi.

<h4> Deep learning generated image </h4>

Is it something that was generated from the original image by learning something like Van Gogh style painting?
