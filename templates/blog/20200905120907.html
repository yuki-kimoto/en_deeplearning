<h2> Representing the number of neurons in the hidden layer </h2>

Let's express the number of neurons in the hidden layer. The hidden layer is the layer between the input layer and the output layer.

Suppose you have three hidden layers. The number of neurons in each layer is 10, 20, 15.

<pre>
#Represents the number of neurons in the hidden layer
my $neuron_counts_in_hidden_layers = [10, 20, 15];
